        <h1>Attributes</h1>
        <p>Attributes allow you to modify behavior of an HTML attribute. You've already seen a few of them but we'll go into a few more examples of them</p>
        <p>A really good example we have seen already is the href attribute of the <a href="www.frontendmasters.com"></a> tag. By modifying the href we're modifying what the tag does. It's contextual as well: href only works on a tags. You can't add a href to a div and expect to suddenly work as a link.</p>
        <p>href and type are specific to a few tags. There are other attributes like class and id that are universal and can be applied to (nearly) all tags. These themselves are inert; they don't do anything, but allow other things to find them later (we'll cover them heavily in CSS and JS sections.)</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>class</h2>
        <p>Classes are more useful than IDs. You should use them 95% of the time. A class is reusable. Now I could create another tag (doesn't even have to be another h3) and that CSS style would be reapplied to it! You can also give multiple classes to one tag.</p>
        <h3 class="the-red-one bloded">This is red and bold</h3>
        <style>
            .bolded{
                font-weight: bold;
            }

            .the-red-one {
                color: red;
            }
        </style>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>ids</h2>
        <p>Classes are far more useful. However there are IDs that you may need occasionally. A key thing is that an ID is unique. Whereas I've already used the the-red-one class twice, you can't do with IDs. They're designed to not be reusable; they're unique to the page.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>slash and link</h2>
        <p>Those links don't go anywhere if you click them. They're relative links. If you have an absolute link like href="www.google.com" that will actually take you to Google. But if your website were www.example.com and on there you had link to href="/about" it would take you to www.example.com/about. It's relative to the base URL. The leading slash means it's always www.example.com/about no matter where you are on the site. </p>
        <p>If you're www.example.com/blah and there's a link to href="about" with no slash, the link will take you to www.example.com/blah/about whereas href="/about" will take you to www.example.com/about.</p>
